          <div class="col-md-12"><center><h4><p>You may ask, why did you decide to start coding at 37?  Well, you'll have to look at my life experiences to understand this. After my undergraduate at Washington State University, I began my career that would last more than 10 years in sales, tech support, customer support, and account management.  Some of my places of employment are not even listed on my resume because it would take another page!  The common conclusion from many of these position was getting laid off because the struggles of the given company.  Each time, people in my position were the first to go.  ANd everytime, the developers were the last to go.  So the most recent layoff, it took me a while to realize I need to know this stuff.  I tired of being expendable.  So I'm rolling the dices and betting on myself.  I looking towards my future, and believe learning to code will be a huge part of that. Please checkout my resume below.</p></h4></center></div>
